          <p className='mb-4'>“People come up to me and they quote Milhouse lines,” Hayden said in a video announcing her retirement, which included a montage of Milhouse clips. “People are always saying what a nerd he is. But one thing that I love about Milhouse is he's always getting knocked down, but he keeps getting up. I love the little guy.”

          <p className='mb-4'>The video also included interview footage of Hayden from years ago, in which she called her “Simpsons” voice acting gig “the greatest job in the world.”
